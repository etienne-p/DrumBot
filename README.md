DrumBot
=======

A drum machine using a cellular automaton as its sequencer.

Execute the code in "main.scd" to launch the app.
A dialog will pop up to let you open a settings file (such as settings/rythm1).
If you don't want to use one, just click "cancel" and the app will start with default / random settings.
